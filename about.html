          <p class="text-block">
          I was born in Oss, the Netherlands on june 29th 1987. Currently I live in Detroit, Michigan with my wife. 
          <br><br>
          My background is in Economics and Marketing, having Bachelor degrees in both of those fields. My second degree was earned in a program combining study with professional work experience, allowing me to do several internships and part-time jobs while completing my study. After my studies I have taught myself HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, WordPress and PHP. 
          <br><br>
          Computers and the online community have always been a passion of mine and it led me to work in online marketing and more recently, web development. 
          <br><br>
          In the past few years I have volunteered as sports coach for young children, coach and support for starting sport coaches. I currently volunteer as mentor and teacher for high potential children. Furthermore I have volunteered as boardmember and website, social media and online presence coordinator for a theatre project. 
          <br><br>
          I am a fast learner, good teamworker and I always keep an overview of the project. I have experience in several different fields and coaching as well as project management and I speak three different languages. Apart from this all I am an easy going, calm guy with a good sense of humor.
